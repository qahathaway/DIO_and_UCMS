# Left Ventricular Segmental Stress-Strain Identifies Unique Myocardial Deformation Patterns Following Intrinsic and Extrinsic Stressors in Mice

### Background
We utilized segmental stress strain analysis to evaluate whether intrinsic (diet-induced obesity (DIO)) and extrinsic (unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)) stressors can alter deformational patterns of the left ventricle and act as a unique “fingerprint” for characterization.

### Methods
6-week-old, male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into lean or obese groups (N = 24/group). The obese group underwent 12 weeks of DIO with a high-fat diet (HFD). At 18 weeks, lean and obese mice were further randomized into UCMS and non-UCMS groups to elicit a chronically stressed phenotype (UCMS; 7 hrs/day, 5 days/week, for 8 weeks). M-Mode, Pulse-Wave Doppler, and speckle tracking echocardiography were assessed at baseline (6 weeks), post-HFD (18 weeks), and post-UCMS (26 weeks). Supervised machine learning with 10-fold cross validation was applied to the DIO and UCMS groups.
